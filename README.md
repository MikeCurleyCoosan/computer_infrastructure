## ***1.0 About this project***
----


This repository contains the assessment tasks and project for the Computer Infrastructure module as part of the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics, at the Atlantic Technological University (ATU) Galway. 

----
## ***2.0 Use of this project***
----


The purpose of the project is to demonstrate an ability to complete the following tasks:

1. Use, configure, and script in a command line interface environment.

2. Manipulate and move data and code using the command line.

3. Compare commonly available software infrastructures and architectures.

4. Select appropriate infrastructure for a given computational task.


### 2.1 Getting Started

To start using this project, simply follow the steps outlined in the [Get Started](#30-get-started) section below. Once you have set up the project, you can begin exploring and analyzing the data in this project right away.

----
## 3.0 Get Started
----

### 3.1 To get stated with this project please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine. 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MikeCurleyCoosan/computer_infrastructure.git

```
2. Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). Anaconda comes with its own set of pre-installed 
data science packages and tools, making it convenient for beginners to set up their environment quickly. The 
pre-installed packages that are required to work with the project are [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), 
[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.
html).

3. Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Visual Studio Code is a code editor 
with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control.

4. Download and install the latest version of [Git](https://git-scm.com/). Git is a free and open source version 
control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

5. Navigate to the project directory in VS Code.

6. Use the weather.ipynb notebook to follow along with the various tasks undertaken during the course of the project. These tasks are using the command line. You may complete these tasks on the command line of the Visual Studio Code distribution you have downloaded above, or you may use GitHub codespaces to complete the tasks. Instructions on using GitHub codespaces are given below if you would rather use this option, which will enable you to complete the tasks without following the steps 1-5 above.


### 3.2 Using GitHub Codespaces to complete the tasks:

1. Create a GitHub account if you don't already have one. You may create a GitHub accound by following the link given [here](https://github.com). 

2. Create a new repository called 'Computer_Infrastructure' in your GitHub account. 

3. Navigate to your new repository. 

4. In your repository click on the green `<> Code` button as shown in the image below.

![codespaces](./images/codespaces.png)

5. Click the Codespaces button at the top of the new window that pops up when you click the green button above.

6. Click create codespace if its your first time using codespace in this repository, otherwise click on your existing codespace.
