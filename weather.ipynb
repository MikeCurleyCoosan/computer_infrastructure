For example if we are in the root of our system and type the `mkdir data` command, a new directory called data will be created at the root of our system. However, if we wish to create subdirectories we could do this using various different methods. \n",

The `-p` flag for example will create the parent directory, if it does not already exist followed by the child directory as specified while using the command. For example if we typed `mkdir -p data/weather` while in the root of our system, the parent directory data would be created in the root of our system, and the child direcory weather would be created inside this folder. We could then reuse this command again in the root of our system to create the timestamps folder by typing `mkdir -p data/timestamps`.\n",

    "We could also just create all the folders at one time. To do this we still use the `-p` flag, but this time we list all the sub-directories after, therefore to create sub-directories weather and timestamps, we use the `mkdir -p data/weather data/timestamps` command. \n",
